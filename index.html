        <h1>Serving Firms Since 1932</h1>
        <p>Started in 1932 by Ray Whimmer as The Overhead Door Company of Toledo, we are the oldest operating garage
            door company in Toledo, Ohio. We are proudly celebrating our 95th year serving the Toledo Area. Over the
            years of operation, the company has evolved and expanded to further serve its customers.

            In 1982, the owner at the time, Lee Huss, founded the fireplace division of the company originally designed
            to serve the builder community. Today, Fireside Hearth and Home of Toledo proudly sells industry leading
            products supported by our own factory trained and certified installers and service technicians.

            <p>
                I come with no wrapping or pretty pink bows.
                I am who I am from my head to my toes.
                I tend to get loud when speaking my mind.
                Even a little crazy some of the time.
            </p>
            <h3>Services 2</h3>
            <p>
                Forever we remain oblivious to the future,
                lost to the past and enduring our torture.
                Forever we take chances to settle our scores,
                losing some battles and winning some wars. ...

            <h3>July 1</h3>
            <p>
                In all chaotic beauty lies a wounded work of art.
                Beautiful but torn, wreaking havoc on my heart.
                Camouflaged by insecurities, blinded by it all.
                I love the way you sit there and barely notice me at all.
            </p>
            <h3>July 2</h3>
            <p>
                To those whom I've fought with
                and to those I don't know your name
                We fought by one another.
                You did not die in vain.

                Little baby Oh so small
                One day you will be big and tall
                I watch you while you laugh and play
                My love for you grows everyday ...

            <h3>Conflict Resolution</h3>
            <p>
                Didn't want a battle,
                Yet you declared war,
                Each knock you gave me made me stronger than before,
                I will not give up,...
